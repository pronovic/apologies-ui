# Apologies UI

This is a browser user interface implements a game similar to the [Sorry](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)>) board game. It is built on top of the [apologies](https://pypi.org/project/apologies/) python library and associated [apologiesserver](https://pypi.org/project/apologiesserver/) websockets server.

Developer documentation is found in [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md). See that file for notes about how the code is structured, how to set up a development environment, etc.
